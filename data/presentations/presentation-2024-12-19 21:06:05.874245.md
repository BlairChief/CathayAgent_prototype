# Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition

## Presenter: YourNameHere

---

## Introduction to ResNet (2015)

- Deep Residual Learning was introduced to tackle the degradation problem when training deep neural networks.
- Developed by Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, and Jian Sun.
- ResNet introduced the concept of **Residual Blocks**.

---

## Solving the Vanishing Gradient Problem

- The **vanishing gradient problem** makes training very deep networks difficult.
- ResNet uses "skip connections" or shortcuts to allow gradients to flow more effectively.
- Enables construction of extremely deep networks.

$$
y = F(x, \{W_i\}) + x
$$

Where \( F(x, \{W_i\}) \) represents the residual function and \( x \) is the input.
